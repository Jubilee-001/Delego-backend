# Database Migrations

Deterministic, checksum-validated SQL migrations for Delego.

## Directory semantics

- `database/schema/` contains the **baseline schema** applied to a brand-new database.
- `database/migrations/` contains **incremental changes** applied after the baseline.
- Baseline files always run before incremental files.
- Within each directory, files run in ascending numeric-prefix order; the filename is the tie-breaker.
The current baseline is:

| Baseline | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `001_initial.sql` | Users, wallets, orders, delegations, delegation policies, permission levels |
| `002_orchestrator_sagas.sql` | Orchestrator saga coordinator state |

### Passkey / WebAuthn configuration (#367)

`040_passkey_credentials.sql` backs the passkey ceremonies. The gateway reads
its relying-party settings from the environment; there are no safe defaults for
the RP ID or origins, so both must be set explicitly:

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `WEBAUTHN_RP_ID` | yes | Registrable domain of the relying party (e.g. `passkeys.delego.io`) |
| `WEBAUTHN_ORIGINS` | yes | Comma-separated list of allowed origins |
| `WEBAUTHN_RP_NAME` | no | User-visible name shown by the authenticator (default `Delego`) |
| `WEBAUTHN_USER_VERIFICATION` | no | `required` (default), `preferred` or `discouraged` |
| `WEBAUTHN_ENFORCE_COUNTER` | no | Set to `false` only for synced passkeys that report a constant counter; this forfeits replay detection |
| `WEBAUTHN_CHALLENGE_TTL_MS` | no | Challenge lifetime in ms (default 300000) |

## Naming rules

```text
<unique-number>_<short_description>.sql
```

- Numbers must be unique within their directory and must never be reused.
- Only forward `.sql` files are treated as migrations; matching `.down.sql` files provide rollback SQL and are ignored as standalone migrations.
- Filenames that do not match `<number>_<description>.sql` fail the migration run.

## Tracking

The runner creates a `schema_migrations` table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS schema_migrations (
  id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  filename TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  migration_group TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (migration_group IN ('schema', 'migration')),
  version INTEGER NOT NULL,
  checksum CHAR(64) NOT NULL,
  applied_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

- Each file is tracked by its relative filename (`schema/001_initial.sql`) and its SHA-256 checksum.
- Each migration runs inside a transaction together with its tracking row, so a failed migration leaves no partial schema and no tracking record.
- Applied files with matching checksums are skipped, making reruns a no-op.
- Editing an already-applied file causes a **checksum mismatch** and the run fails before applying anything else. To change the schema, create a new migration instead.
- Deleting or renaming an applied migration file is also reported as an error.
- Duplicate version numbers within one directory fail validation before any SQL executes.
- Runs are serialized with the PostgreSQL advisory lock `hashtext('delegobackend:schema-migrations')`.

## Commands

```bash
# Apply all pending migrations
pnpm db:migrate

# Show applied/pending migrations and checksum health
pnpm db:migrate:status

# Print pending SQL without executing it
pnpm db:migrate:dry-run

# Generate the next forward/rollback pair
pnpm db:migrate:create add_example

# Roll back the latest migration (requires an explicit safety flag)
pnpm db:migrate -- --direction down --force

# Inspect rollback SQL through version 12
pnpm db:migrate -- --direction down --target 12 --dry-run
```

The runner connects using `DATABASE_URL` (defaults to `postgresql://delego:delego@localhost:5432/delego`). For tests, `DELEGO_SCHEMA_DIR` and `DELEGO_MIGRATIONS_DIR` can override the migration directories.

## Fresh setup

```bash
docker compose up -d --wait postgres
pnpm db:migrate
pnpm db:migrate:status
```

A clean database must contain all expected tables before backend services are started.

## Creating a migration

1. Run `pnpm db:migrate:status` to see the highest applied number.
2. Create `database/migrations/<next-number>_<description>.sql`. Never reuse or renumber existing files.
3. Write plain SQL — each file runs exactly once inside a transaction. Avoid non-transactional statements such as `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY`.
4. Test locally against a clean database (`docker compose down -v && docker compose up -d --wait postgres && pnpm db:migrate`).
5. Update this README's migration table.
6. Never edit an applied migration file: the recorded SHA-256 checksum will no longer match and every subsequent `db:migrate`/`db:migrate:status` fails until the file is restored.

Rollback runs the matching `.down.sql` in a transaction and removes its history row only after the SQL succeeds. A rollback without a down file, or without `--force`, is refused. Review a rollback with `--dry-run` before executing it; production rollback should also be approved through the deployment change process.
